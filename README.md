# Music Player Project

## Description

As a part of web develeopment course of Coding Ninjas,  we were asked to build screens for a music player using pure HTML and CSS (without Bootstrap or any other frontend framework).

## Specification

* Home Screen Carousel  - Try creating home screen carousel using CSS. For now it will be with dummy images, but ensure the functionality. 

* Code Quality - Ensure good code quality in terms of using classes, proper names for classes/variables, neatness of code and less redundant code.

* Comments - You should add proper comments to the files, where you feel. This will improve readability of your code and will also help Teaching Assistants to understand it better. 

* Innovation - Although you are given basic template, feel free to explore more and add interesting features to your Music Player. You can also try different themes for the player(CSS Variables will help!)
